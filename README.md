## 🖥️ VB-CABLE Installation Guide (A + B Drivers)

The VB-CABLE package includes **two separate virtual audio drivers** that must both be installed for full functionality:

- `VBCABLE_A_Driver_Pack43`
- `VBCABLE_B_Driver_Pack43`

Please follow the steps below **for each driver folder**.

### ⚙️ Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Download and unzip** the VB-CABLE ZIP package to a folder on your computer.

2. You will find two folders:
   - `VBCABLE_A_Driver_Pack43`
   - `VBCABLE_B_Driver_Pack43`

3. Open the **first folder** (`VBCABLE_A_Driver_Pack43`) and **run the correct installer _as Administrator_**:
   - On a **64-bit system**: run `VBCABLE_Setup_x64.exe`
   - On a **32-bit system**: run `VBCABLE_Setup.exe`

   > 🔐 _To run as Administrator: Right-click the installer and select **"Run as administrator"**._

4. Wait for the installation to complete. It may appear unresponsive — this is normal. A message will confirm when it's done.

5. Repeat the same steps for the **second folder** (`VBCABLE_B_Driver_Pack43`).

6. **Reboot your computer** after both installations are complete to activate the drivers.

### 📌 Notes

- Both **A** and **B** drivers are required for multi-cable routing scenarios.
- Each driver appears as a separate virtual audio device in your system.
